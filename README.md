🧭 Introduction

This is our group's PPS project where we made Project simulating  a secure Electronic Voting System (EVS) similar to real digital voting machines.
the system demonstrates:

Secure authentication

Data integrity mechanisms

Use of dynamic memory, pointers, and modular programming

Proper separation of concerns using multiple .c files

The system is simple but includes the core concepts used in real-world systems like EVMs and online voting portals.


It includes:


Voter registration & authentication

Candidate registration

Secure vote casting (one vote per voter)

Transaction logging with checksum-based tamper detection

Audit trail & reporting

Dynamic memory allocation for voters, candidates, and logs

Modular design with 4 independent source files

We made this completely in C language using VS Code ,and the program runs in terminal/console only (no website or UI).


🚀 Key Features

🔐 1. Voter Registration & Authentication

Unique voter IDs

4-digit PIN system

Verification of voter identity

“One voter = one vote” enforcement

🗳 2. Candidate Registration

Add unlimited candidates using dynamic memory

Store candidate names and IDs

Auto-tally votes

🧾 3. Vote Casting

Voter logs in securely

Chooses from available candidates

Vote is added to the candidate

Voter cannot vote twice

Auto-generation of transaction logs

🧩 4. Audit Trail (Log System)

Logs every vote:

Voter ID

Candidate ID

Timestamp

Auto-generated checksum

Detects any manipulation in the data

📊 5. Results & Reporting

Display final vote count

Audit log verification output (OK / CORRUPTED)

🧠 6. Memory & Structure Concepts

Dynamic memory (malloc, realloc)

Pointers

Multiple structures

Modular code (5 files)
